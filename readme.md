## fCC "shortlink" microservice

This was part of a *Back-end Developer* course on freeCodeCamp.

Objective was to create an API that would return json object containing a short link for submitted link.

**Added "non-user" story: If the original link already exists in the database, the previous one is returned. This should ensure that we don't end up with redundant copies to google.com.**
